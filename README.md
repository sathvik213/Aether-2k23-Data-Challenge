The files ```sample.csv ``` is created for training only by sampling out the data from data(which is cleaned by me after performing data cleaning operations from the original given datasets(4 datasets))<br>
The files ```sample_test.csv ``` is created for model testing by sampling out the data from data(which is cleaned by me after performing data cleaning operations from the original given datasets(4 datasets))<br>
<h5>NOTE: The both csv datasets are completely <i>different</i> from eachother and <i>sampling</i> is done due to unavailability of computationally rich machine</h3><br>

The file ```final_model is written here.ipynb ``` is where the model training and exporting is done<br>

The file <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P8L9Ox0kQQXSYlUkw11Thg_Of9Td1RDH/view?usp=share_link'>```grand_finale.csv``` </a>(used in file ```for data testing and submission.ipynb  ``` ) is cleaned csv file of given input test data set(is not uploaded here in github due to storage issues, click on the hyperlink for the data)

The file ```for data testing and submission.ipynb  ``` is where the model is applied on the given test dataset and output is saved in csv.<br>

The file ```mango.pkl ``` is the model that is created<br>

The final output csv file for test input data is ```output_sathvik_tummala.csv```
